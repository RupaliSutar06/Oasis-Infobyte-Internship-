# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Project

## 📌 Description

This project focuses on predicting the **price of a car** using **machine learning techniques**.
The prediction is based on various car features such as brand, model, year, fuel type, transmission, and other relevant attributes.

The project is implemented using **Jupyter Notebook** and includes **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis**, **model training**, and **price prediction**.
