# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Project

## 📌 Description

This project focuses on predicting the **price of a car** using **machine learning techniques**.  
The prediction is based on various car features such as brand, model, year, fuel type, transmission, and other relevant attributes.

The project is implemented using **Python scripts** and includes **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, and **price prediction**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze car dataset and understand feature relationships
* Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
* Visualize important patterns in the data
* Train a machine learning regression model
* Predict car prices accurately
